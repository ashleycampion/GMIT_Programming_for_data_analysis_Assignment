# GMIT_Programming_for_data_analysis_Assignment
This repository contains the practical assignment for the programming for data analysis module

### Problem statement
The following assignment concerns the numpy.random package in Python [1]. You are
required to create a Jupyter [2] notebook explaining the use of the package, including
detailed explanations of at least five of the distributions provided for in the package.
There are four distinct tasks to be carried out in your Jupyter notebook.
1. Explain the overall purpose of the package.
2. Explain the use of the “Simple random data” and “Permutations” functions.
3. Explain the use and purpose of at least five “Distributions” functions.
4. Explain the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers.


## Solutions / Response
My solutions / response to the problem statement can be found in the Jupyter Notebook contained in the same directory as this readme file, entitled *Programming for Data Analysis - Assignment.ipynb*. While the Notebook can be viewed in a browser, in order to run the code for yourself, you will need to open the .ipynb file in Juptyer itself. Details on how to install Jupyter can be found at [3], and details on how to run Jupyter Notebook to interact with the code in the .ipynb file can be found at [4].
