# GMIT_Programming_for_data_analysis_Assignment
This repository contains the practical assignment for the programming for data analysis module, as well as the project for the same module.

## Assignment statement
The following assignment concerns the numpy.random package in Python [1]. You are
required to create a Jupyter [2] notebook explaining the use of the package, including
detailed explanations of at least five of the distributions provided for in the package.
There are four distinct tasks to be carried out in your Jupyter notebook.
1. Explain the overall purpose of the package.
2. Explain the use of the “Simple random data” and “Permutations” functions.
3. Explain the use and purpose of at least five “Distributions” functions.
4. Explain the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers.


### Solutions / Response to Assignment
My solutions / response to the problem statement can be found in the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/ashleycampion/GMIT_Programming_for_data_analysis_Assignment/blob/main/Programming%20for%20Data%20Analysis%20-%20Assignment.ipynb) contained in the same directory as this readme file, entitled *Programming for Data Analysis - Assignment.ipynb*. While the Notebook can be viewed in a browser, in order to run the code for yourself, you will need to open the .ipynb file in Juptyer itself. Details on how to install Jupyter can be found at [3], and details on how to run Jupyter Notebook to interact with the code in the .ipynb file can be found at [4].




## Project Statement
For this project you must create a data set by simulating a real-world phenomenon of your choosing. You may pick any phenomenon you wish – you might pick one that is of interest to you in your personal or professional life. Then, rather than collect data related to the phenomenon, you should model and synthesise such data using Python. We suggest you use the numpy.random package for this purpose. Specifically, in this project you should:

* Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.
* Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other.
* Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.
* Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook – the data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.
* Note that this project is about simulation – you must synthesise a data set. Some students may already have some real-world data sets in their own files. It is okay to base your synthesised data set on these should you wish (please reference it if you do), but the main task in this project is to create a synthesised data set.
