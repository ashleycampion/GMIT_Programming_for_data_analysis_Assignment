    "### 1. Explain the overall purpose of the package.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is an interesting analogy between the numpy package itself, and its child package, numpy.random [3]. Just as numpy is so much more than a package that simply allows one to efficiently create multi-dimensional arrays, numpy.random is so much more than a package that just allows one to efficiently create random numbers (or pseudo-random numbers - pseudoransomness will be discussed below, under the 'SeedSequance' object). Just as numpy allows the user to easily and efficiently *do* things with matrices, numpy.random allows one to *do* things with random numbers, namely, generate them according to what are called * probability distributions*. In this sense, numpy.random allows the user to create both random numbers as well as numbers that are more or less probable. Numpy.random also has further use cases such as performing certain actions on arrays like randomly choosing a selection of items from the array of shuffling the contents of the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 'structure' of the numpy.random package is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The object that the user is expected to interact with is the 'Generator' [4]. This is the object that can call the various functions which generate numbers according to a certain probability distribution (as well other functions such as shuffling).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. This 'Generator' object itself uses another lower-level object that the user generally does not need to interact with, as this object can be created and handled in the background when the user creates the 'Generator' object. This lower-level object is the 'BitGenerator' [5], and this object is responsible for actually generating the random streams bits which the 'Generator' will then take up and apply a probablity distribution to. The 'BitGenerator' can be thought of as the conveyor belt that provides the numpy.random factory with random bits, and the 'Generator' can be thought of as the machine that 'decides' which bits to keep and which to discard according to the probability selection that the user, the machine operator, has selected on.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. There is one further object in the numpy.random package, the 'SeedSequence' [6]. This object is used to determine the initial entropy that will be used by the 'BitGenerator' object to generate its pseudorandom bitstream. When a 'BitGenerator' object is created without first specifying the 'SeedSequence' to be used, the entropy is taken from the Operating System itself. The only case where this is not acceptable is where the psuedorandom bitstreams (and thus the pseudorandom numbers generated by the 'Generator' object) need to be repeatable for whatever reason. In this case, the user can create a 'SeedSequence' object, note the entropy of that object (SeedSequence.entropy), and then use that same initial entropy every time a 'BitGenerator' object needs to be created. This will allow the user to obtain identical sets of pseudorandom numbers (hence their *pseudorandomness* - they are actually created from a *specified* initial entropy and a *specified* algorithm).\n",
    "\n",
    "Although one could first create a SeedSequence object using the SeedSequence constructor, then pass that to the BitGenerator constructor to create a a BitGenerator object, and finally pass that to a Generator constructor to create a Generator object to actually call the various functions that will generate the random numbers etc., the numpy documentation recommends simply creating a Generator object directly using the **default_rng** constructor, which handles the bit stream generation in the background. I will use this default constructor except where I wish to demonstrate what manually creating a SeedSequence object can achieve."

If one knows the inital entropy state and the algorithm, then one knows what numbers will be generated, hence the not-quite-random nature of the numbers. Numpy uses the random.SeedSequance class to determine the initial entropy state, and the random.BitGenerator class to determine the algorithm and combine it with a SeedSequance object to create the random bit stream that will be used by the Generator class to generate random numbers according to a particular probability distribution. It is important to note, however, that while a bit stream can be reproducible if one known its entropy and algorithm, the actual distribution produced by the Generator functions using that bit stream will not be.\n",
